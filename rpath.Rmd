# Food Web models (Rpath module) {#rpath}

As usual, course materials not in the github repository can be found in the course Google Drive [course-materials folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wt4fhAgCP92aBu_XSCQq50Xrkc-UVHnx?usp=sharing). Everything will of course be linked to here on the website.  

A three-class sequence of class sessions on mass balance foodweb modeling using the `R` implementation of the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) framework, known as `Rpath`, given by guest lecturer Dr. Sean Lucey of NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center.
