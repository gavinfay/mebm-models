# TMB Workshop {#tmb}

The first part of the course will be dedicated to an introductory training workshop to the statistical modeling software package Template Model Builder  (TMB), with additional class sessions.  

_TMB is an R package that provides quick implementation for fitting complex models to data, has many applications for statistical ecological modeling, and is becoming the standard method for implementing fisheries stock assessment models._

Condensing some of the software instruction part of the course into a more dense period has some advantages:  
1. a good way to learn is to be actively practicing; and with more focused sessions we can better help you get into a rhythm (we'll still be using examples relevant to the course, but this also helps to separate learning software from some other course objectives).  
2. there are a number of things going on in the fall that will disrupt our schedule (e.g. ICES annual science conference), and this is one way of ensuring you still get your money's worth for the course.  
3. there are others interested in TMB training and a short workshop format provides an easier way for these people to participate.  
4. this approach has seemed to work for me in the past, and for others who teach similar material.  

The sequence for the TMB training will be:  

09/01 9:00-10:00  Software installation troubleshooting session (not required)  
09/06 9:00-10:30  TMB workshop session 1  
09/06 1:00-2:30  TMB workshop session 2 (regular MAR 580 class time)  
09/08 9:00-10:30  TMB workshop session 3  
09/08 1:00-2:30  TMB workshop session 4 (regular MAR 580 class time)  


__Documentation__: The online [TMB book](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/_book/Introduction.html) is a great place to start.
