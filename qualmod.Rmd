# Qualitative Ecosystem Modeling {#qualmod}

As usual, course materials not in the github repository can be found in the course Google Drive [course-materials folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wt4fhAgCP92aBu_XSCQq50Xrkc-UVHnx?usp=sharing). Everything will of course be linked to here on the website.

The below 2 papers (suggest reading the Dambacher one first) give an introduction to qualitative ecosystem modeling.

Here is an [excellent short presentation by SMAST PhD Dr. Robert Wildermuth](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmf4x45euofhhb/Video_Wildermuth_WCMAC_20210317.mp4?dl=0) on development and application of these models to marine spatial planning in Washington State.  

The following 2 papers provide good applications of the methods.
